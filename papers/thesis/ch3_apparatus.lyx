Experimental apparatus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial investigations of the compressible vortex ring formation process
 were carried out on several testbed platforms using high-speed Schlieren
 imaging to guide and validate the design of a vortex ring generator.
 Following the installation and qualification of the vortex ring generator
 in the Wisconsin Shock Tube, the multifluid vortex-shock interaction process
 was imaged using high-speed simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence
 and particle image velocimetry.

\begin_layout Standard
The design process proceeded in three iterations, starting with proof of
 concept based on galvanized steel Schedule 40 plumbing connectors purchased
 from a local hardware store, moving to a low-pressure testbed mimicking
 the dimensions of the shock tube, and culminating in a high-strength apparatus
 permanently installed in the shock tube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing literature on vortex generation from the open end of a shock tube
 lent credence to the basic concept 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Arakeri2004,Murugan2012,Poudel2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but several operational constraints necessitated a novel design.
 Prior art generally involves discharge of air-formed vortex rings into
 the ambient atmosphere without shock interaction, while this research effort
 is fundamentally motivated by the study of mixing, which necessitates both
 an initial condition which is unmixed and a diagnostic technique which
 allows visualization of mixedness.
 Because of the dimensional limitations of the shock tube facility, the
 size of the vortex generator was constricted both by the limited vertical
 space between the end-wall of the shock tube and the concrete floor, as
 well as the desire to avoid wall effects in a 25 cm square cross section.
 Temporal uncertainty on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm100$
\end_inset

 ms in the delay between boost tank fast-acting valve actuation and initiation
 of diaphragm rupture required vortex ring generation to be initiated immediatel
y after detection of the main shock wave by a pressure transducer.
 Additionally, tight control of vortex generator rupture timing and pre-rupture
 gas state and composition was needed to ensure the occurrence of the shock
 waveâ€“vortex interaction within the imaging window at a predefined imaging
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These constraints were addressed by several design elements, with novelties
 including pulsed laser-induced rupture of the vortex ring generator diaphragm
 and maintenance of initial separation between driven and ambient gas by
 evacuation of excess acetone-seeded gas via an annular slot encircling
 the exit orifice.

\begin_layout Standard
Pulsed lasers allow for inexpensive production of high-energy-density conditions
 with the aid of focusing optics, with widespread commercial application
 to material processing.
 These advancements have been harnessed by fluid dynamicists to provide
 illumination for most modern flow visualization techniques, with a resultant
 abundance of high-power pulsed lasers in many shock tube laboratories.
 Such lasers can be usefully repurposed as a means of rupturing thin diaphragms
 in a tightly controlled fashion, allowing exact repetition of rupture pressure
 and shock release timing.
 For these experiments, the fundamental 1064 nm output of a dual-cavity
 Nd:YAG Ekspla NL-303D laser was expanded by a 3X beam telescope, separated
 by a polarized beamsplitter, focused by a pair of orthogonally-oriented
 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\SI{200}{\milli\meter}$
\end_inset

 cylindrical lenses, and recombined by another polarizing beamsplitter into
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 shape directed at the vortex ring generator diaphragm.

All shock-vortex interaction experiments were conducted in the Wisconsin
 Shock Tube Laboratory's

\begin_inset Formula $\SI{2}{m}$
\end_inset

 driver section into a test section with a square 
\begin_inset Formula $25.4\times25.4$
\end_inset

 cm cross-section.
 The facility is nominally capable of withstanding pressures up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\SI{10}{MPa}$
\end_inset

 with a factor of safety of 2, although it was operated at less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\SI{2}{MPa}$
\end_inset

 for these experiments.
 It has hosted a wide range of experiments over its more than 20 years in
 service, including shock mitigation studies for inertial confinement fusion,
 shock-bubble interactions, and studies of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability
 with several membraneless initial conditions.
 The basic configuration of the facility for the present work is similar
 to its original layout as described by Anderson 
\emph on

 to design and validate a vortex ring generator using high-speed Schlieren
 imaging.
 The cylinder diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{p}$
\end_inset

 was constrained by the dimensions of adjacent visualization laser entry
 windows, leaving the lengths of the driver and driven sections to be determined
 by experiments.
 The initial hypothesis was that a driver section with a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $15.2$

 cm would allow the vortex ring to reach the limiting formation number 
\begin_inset Formula $N=4$
\end_inset

 An acetone bath is held at 293 K and pressurized with argon to 305 kPa,
 seeding the argon with 8% acetone by volume.
 A steady stream of acetone-seeded argon is introduced to the driven section
 of the vortex ring generator, with excess argon removed by the annular
 vacuum slot encircling the vortex generator outlet.
 Several seconds prior to the arrival of the shock wave, the vortex ring
 generator driver is pressurized with argon to 300 kPa.
 The shock tube driver is then rapidly pressurized to 1.9 MPa, at which point
 the aluminum diaphragm separating the driver and driven sections ruptures,
 generating a shock wave of nominal strength 
\begin_inset Formula $M=1.8$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the shock wave travels down the driven section of the shock tube, the
 associated pressure rise is detected by a high-frequency pressure transducer,
 triggering the laser-induced rupture of the vortex ring generator diaphragm
 and initiating imaging by the pulse-burst laser and high-speed cameras.
 The initial propagation of the vortex ring, its acceleration by the shock
 wave, and its continued propagation following re-shock is then captured
 during the 10 ms imaging duration.
